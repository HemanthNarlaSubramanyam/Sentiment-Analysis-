# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis, an integral part of Natural Language Processing (NLP), is a technique used to analyze digital text in order to determine its emotional tone. It involves categorizing text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, offering valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, market trends, and social media perceptions.

Today, businesses generate vast amounts of unstructured textual data, encompassing emails, customer support chats, social media remarks, and reviews. Understanding customer attitudes and perceptions has become crucial for enhancing customer service.

Python, as expected, offers a solution to effortlessly tackle this.

Python offers several libraries that enable us to conduct sentiment analysis effectively such as VADER, Pattern, TextBlob, spaCy, CoreNLP, amongsy others.

By evaluating word polarity and subjectivity, Python’s sentiment analysis play a crucial role in providing insights pivotal for decision-making across industries, revolutionizing data-driven decision strategies.

We will be using McDonald_s_Reviews.csv from Kaggle’s McDonald’s Store Reviews dataset to perform the analysis using the VADER library.
